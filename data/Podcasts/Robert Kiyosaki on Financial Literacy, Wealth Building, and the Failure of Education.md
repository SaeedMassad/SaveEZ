# Robert Kiyosaki on Financial Literacy, Wealth Building, and the Failure of Education

[00:00:00] Robert Kiyosaki, welcome to Dad Saves America. I'll tell you that Dad Saves America is a perfect name for my brand too, right? That's right. Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I am so excited. We have talked about having you on the show for a long time and, um, our time is limited, so there's so much more that we could talk about together than we have time for.

Sure. I want to start with the present because you are, you are an icon of macro financial literacy and. This is a very weird time, it feels like, um, so how do you understand what's happening in the economy and what we as parents and as homeowners should be preparing for and thinking about? Well, without getting political, you know, uh, Donald Trump and I wrote two books together because we're concerned.

about the lack of financial education in our school systems. So you think about the [00:01:00] source of it. If there's no financial education in our school systems, then the people running our government are idiots. See, I wonder, you know, like people say, well, the Federal Reserve Bank has either 400 or 4, 000 PhDs.

My mind goes closer, that's 4, 000 or 4, 000, like my poor dad's. They're academic geniuses who know jack about money. And they're killing us. So when I see that, and then you have, my generation was the first baby boom generation. Was the first generation without a defined benefit pension plan. Defined benefit was like, you know, when my, my father, Generation.

They worked for Ford or General Motors and they, they had a pension for life. But in 1974 that changed. So they shifted to the 401k and I-R-A-R-R-S-P in Canada, uh, 401k in Japan. [00:02:00] So the boomer generation is kind of hanging out there on a string right now. And now we're starting to retire. So that was 74 to now.

And how many years that is. But the boomer generation had the easiest time in all history, you know, the economy boomed. Yeah, but now it's about to shift and I am afraid the boomer generation might be, you know, out of luck. All right, I'll keep this quick. If you like what you're hearing and want to hear more, don't forget to hit that like button and subscribe to the channel so you won't miss our new content as it comes out every week.

And now back to the conversation. One of the things that I feel like isn't really getting talked about is the, is that, I mean, people are talking, some people are talking about our demographics shifting, but we do have this pending sort of financial catastrophe, which is where it seems like worldwide.

We've never been in a place where there's so few, so few [00:03:00] workers. Young people for so many old people. How do you think about what that means for, for, for, for all of us? Well, that's kind of my, my shared concern. I don't know what's going to happen, but something has to happen. You know, that old saying is how'd you go bankrupt slowly and then fast.

Well, the speed's about to go fast right now. All over the world, you look at Japan, you know, when I was a kid, they were the miracle of Japan. Well, now their yen is worth nothing. And you know, Japanese aren't the brightest when it comes to money. I'm Japanese. I say that fourth generation Jap, American Japanese, I mean, they print more money than we do.

So, I mean, what, that's what I'm saying. So if our school systems teach us nothing about money, then we have idiots running the show. Oh, what is the. Most important, basic fact of, you know, [00:04:00] financial literacy that people don't know or don't understand at all. Like, if there's a top confusion or ignorance, what would that be and, and help our viewers sort of understand?

Well, that's all I did in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. You know, my poor dad was the head of education, the state of Hawaii, PhD, did studies at Stanford, Northwestern, University of Chicago. And, uh, he was poor as a church mouse, but he held up his PhD. I said, yeah, that, that and 25 bucks will buy you a cup of coffee.

You know what I mean? What good is a PhD? And they get so, you know, so many people who get so attached to a stupid piece of paper. And my, so that's, so my rich dad was my best friend's father, never had an education. And he always said, my banker has never asked me for my report card yet. So what does your banker want to see?

So these idiot left wing academic types that go, I went to [00:05:00] Stanford and, uh, my banker wants to see my financial statement. My poor dad had no idea what a financial statement is. Most academics have no idea. They don't have financial statements. But to be a capitalist, I run on my financial statement. You know, because 1971, Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and the U.

S. dollar became debt. So today, if we stop borrowing money, the economy collapses because it's debt. So when this, Dave Ramsey is kind of a friend of mine, but we are with different points of view. He says, live debt free. I said, if we live debt free, the economy would collapse. Oh, no, it wouldn't, does it? Well, if you study macroeconomics, if we don't borrow, money is created by borrowing money.

Not working for it anymore. So if you can understand that macro concept, [00:06:00] and then today America is now printing, this is 2024. We just started printing a trillion dollars every 90 days to keep this economy floating. Now, when they stop, that's, that's like Noah's Ark going down, you know, on top of the mountain.

I first started getting into these kinds of issues, um, about 15 years ago because the financial crisis 2008 happened and I was a young dad and I had my first mortgage and I suddenly, for the first time in my life. I was thinking about interest rates, which no one had told me about or talked about. It wasn't a thing that you encountered in your education.

Um, we're, we're now to a place where interest rates have gone up, but in the bigger sweep of American has recent American history, there's still. They're pretty low. They're lower than my [00:07:00] parents had to pay with their first house was like interest rates are 20%. How do you think about sort of that landscape, the landscape for interest rates and home ownership?

Well, I, I'm kind of on the, all coins have three sides, heads, tails, and the edge. So you have Republicans, Democrat, but I stand on the edge, you know, look at both sides and you have right and left and all this stuff. So when I look at money. You have to see what's invisible. You have to see the other side.

And so when the 2008 market hit, like I said, money was dead. What the banks were doing was they were borrowing money and then packaging debt as an asset so they could borrow more money. They're called derivatives. And the average American, since they're financially illiterate, they don't speak the language of money.

[00:08:00] When I speak a derivative, that's like if you get an orange, you cut it, you squeeze it. The orange juice is a derivative of the orange. So what a derivative is in 2008 was a derivative of debt made into bigger debt. So the debt accelerated. So Warren Buffett has called derivatives weapons of mass financial destruction.

So I'm sitting there like this, watching it, 2008 comes, it blew. Thank you, God. Thank you. Because when you see the other side. I got more, I made, I made more money in the crash than I did when I was going up. So the average person, because they don't have financial literacy, definition of words, and they're taught to just work for money, they don't see the other side.

They cannot see what they cannot see. So when the markets crashed in 2008, I borrowed 300 million dollars. You borrowed 300 million. And [00:09:00] I bought the best real estate in the world for pennies on a dollar. That's how you get rich. Not by working hard and putting in a stupid 401k full of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs.

Those are for the peasants. Jeez. Oh, you know what I mean? Well that's when I told the kids, go to school, get a job, work hard. And put your money in a 401k or an IRA full of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs. I don't touch that garbage. It's trash. You, but you don't know if you don't know, right? Well, so this is one of the things in your book, right?

It's um, the concept of investing in assets and understanding the difference between an asset and a liability. So for the financially, um, yet to be literate, what, what are those concepts and why are they so important? Again, all coins are three sides, heads, tails, and the edge. It's got to [00:10:00] be the other side.

So for there to be an asset, there has to be a liability, by definition. If you understand that one, you'll say, okay, so here's the asset. What's the liability? Give me an example. Well, I wouldn't touch a mutual fund, you know, that's toxic. But the liability Is the, the Black Rocks or the, the fund managers who package that stuff.

All coins are three sides. I'm on the other side. I package it. That's why Buffett called, you know, derivatives weapons of mass financial destruction. I package that debt. And that's how I make my money. So I know what those guys who are like Black Rock and all these guys, Mutual Fund, they're Vanguard.

They're just packaging garbage and selling it. I wouldn't touch it. What should [00:11:00] the average person do with their savings right now, from your perspective? Like in broad strokes, not some particular asset class or something, but what, what, like if I'm, if I'm, if I have savings that I can put somewhere, what's a good strategy for me?

Well, you put a study, you know, a village idiot and their money are soon gone. You know, they just, they all disappear. If you read Rich Dad Poor Dad, you know, it's the number one book in the world for 27 years. And I flunked out of school because I can't write. And the publishers of New York, like Simon Schuster, they all turned Rich Dad Poor Dad down.

They said, because they're all like, my poor dad, these academics are the worst people on planet Earth because they have this stupid piece of paper that says you're smarter than that guy over there. I used to say in my poetry, it's a piece of paper, show me your financials. [00:12:00] Oh, I got my PhD. If you can understand the insanity of that, that somebody actually thinking their PhD makes them smarter than the village idiot out there.

If you can understand that insanity. So anyway, I don't know where I was going with this whole thing, but you have, that's why Trump and I are good friends because we sit there and laugh and chuckle. You know, when Hillary, he was debating Hillary. That, uh, criminal, a violent, Jesus Christ. Well, they are. They are.

You're not wrong. Well, you know, when, when Hillary says, and he doesn't pay any taxes, and Trump says, that means I'm smart. Like, I don't pay taxes. Only idiots pay taxes. You're making a lot of friends with these, with this stuff. Oh, there's, they have, they, my poor dad hopped onto his PhD. I'm going. You're broke, you're working hard, you pay taxes, [00:13:00] and you're saving dollars?

And they're printing dollars? But I have a PhD. Uh, my other friend has a real estate license. He says, I have a real estate license. You don't. I said, yeah, because I don't want. I have a real estate license. I think I'm, I'm doing my best for your audience to show you the insanity of our public today. They think a lousy piece of paper like the dollar bill is important.

Well, it's a piece of paper. It's a derivative. If those things aren't important, what, what is? Assets. So, as Rich Dad pointed out, I said there's three main rules. The rich don't work for money. What I do as a capitalist is I create assets. So I take debt, all this I assemble, I put a piece of real estate together or business, or like right now I'm up in Northern Canada buying lithium fields.

We're gonna crush lithium for batteries, EV batteries, and batteries. So we create assets [00:14:00] and so that asset pays money. So every month I said I have 1,600 rental units every month, 1,600 people who would probably went to school. Pay me rent, God bless them. And guess what? Because they're paying me and my property's 100 percent debt, I pay no taxes.

That's why Trump says I'm smart. But the average person says, well, I, I pay more taxes than you. I said, well, you're an idiot. No, if you understand tax law, America was founded as a tax revolt, 1773, it was a thing called the Boston Tea Party. We don't want to pay taxes. But if you read Karl Marx and his book, The Communist Manifesto, taxes are essential for the spread of communism.

My poor dad was also head of the labor union. What did Marx say about labor unions? Workers of the world unite. [00:15:00] You understand. Getting, you're getting back to the basics here. This is great. I, but I understand this stuff. That's Lecy, you know, so anyway, rich don't work for money. I create assets. We don't save money and your house is not an asset.

So the average poor person, you know, went to college like my dad, PhDs, go to school, get a job, work hard, save money, get out of debt, and you buy a house. 'cause your house is your biggest asset. That is the dark side of the coin, but it's the light side for the idiots. They're doing what they think is smart, and the guys on my side, like Trump's side, are going, I wouldn't do that.

But you can't tell them that because the guy, this stupid piece of pape, says you're smart. My dad says, I'm smarter than your rich dad. I said, yeah, you're also broke. So this is a, uh, a radical thing for people to hear that haven't read your book. The idea that your home is an asset. I mean, this is, [00:16:00] I think this is the largest asset on most people's Um, personal portfolio, personal balance sheet.

Their home. Is their home. Right? So, but. How is your home not an asset? Because you have to understand cash flow. Two most important words. If you read a, if you read financials, that's what your banker wants to see. Your banker wants to see a financial, not your GPA, not your report card, you know, not your college degree.

They want to see assets, liabilities, and cash flow. So there's three basic parts to a financial statement. Banker's statement. Balance sheet, statement of cash flow. You can teach a monkey that, but our schools don't teach that. It is shocking that still to this day, a high school graduate will not encounter those three ideas.

Because they're taught by Marxists. No, they are. You and I agree on that. No, I don't mean they're bad people. Please hear me wrong. This is a [00:17:00] ring, I'm called a ring knocker. There's five federal academies. West Point, Naval Academy, Air Force, Coast Guard, King's Point. I went to King's Point in New York. The first book we're required to read is the Communist Manifesto.

Really? Yes. 1965, I'm reading the Communist Manifesto going, because it was economics. That's real economics. Not that bullshit they teach you in school, Econ 101 and Econ, no. It's communism versus capitalism. Adam Smith versus Karl Marx. It's basic. But our academics are idiots. They got this piece of stupid paper that says you got a Ph.

D. I'm going, good, pay me my rent, I'll be happy. So, when you encounter a student who is, is under the throes of um, belief that communism is the future and that, oh, look, capitalism has failed for whatever reason, what do you say [00:18:00] to them? Gotta study a little bit more. I'm not saying common, you know, I'm, I'm not saying being a Marxist is bad.

Because economics, because my economics teacher was a West Point graduate, you know, the U. S. military school. I went to military school. He was a West Point graduate, flew B 17s in World War II. Got shot down, captured, escaped, all that stuff. And he says, economics is like a religion. So you could be Catholic.

You could be Hindu, you know, you could be Jewish, could be Buddhist. So economics is like an economic religion. And he says, so Marxists believe in this religion, capitalists believe in this religion. So I'm reading the Communist Manifesto, 1965, a family of Marxists, and my dad headed the teachers union. Can you imagine that?[00:19:00] 

And that's what Marx said, labor, workers of the world unite, form unions. And so I, I worked for my rich dad one time during a year because my rich dad was the exact opposite of my poor dad, you know, rich dad was a capitalist and his workers went on strike. So rich dad called me up. He says, come help us out.

So I went down to his hotels, he owned hotels. And I'm working behind the desk. So I'm out there for like three or four days because, you know, there's no workers. Workers are on strike and all this stuff. They went, they were, they were voting for unionism. That's what the workers were on strike for. I got home and my poor dad said, where have you been?

I said, I called home and I said, I know, but where have you been? I said, I was working. He says, you're a scab. You broke the union lines. It was the end of my relationship with my dad. He says, you're a scab, but dad, I was just helping this guy out. No, [00:20:00] you should have let those guys strike against him. That's the number one rule of Marxism.

Abolition of private property. Yeah. You just read the books. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. That, um, we, I did a recent video about, uh, a couple of videos about Marx, Marxism. And I think that's the, that is essentially what I understand to be the, the simplest definition is the abolition of private property is Marxism.

Yeah. But how you get there is that, uh, you know, workers of the world unite, go up against them, strike, take their money. Uh, I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but that was my father. It's a hard environment to try to understand which assets to buy. So is there a way and how to, how to get your first step on the ladder?

I think it's easy for people to think about, well, I'm going to get it, I'm going to get a job and I'm going to, you know, get. I'm going to enter this field, I'm going to get whatever entry level opportunity and work my way up. What's the equivalent [00:21:00] in the asset world for that first rung of the ladder?

Well, again, it's financial literacy, it's simply the definition. An asset puts money in your pocket. Whether you work or not, so a 401k is a liability because it's taking money from your pocket and these village idiots academic types I have a 401k You're an idiot because it's taking money from your pocket going you give it to guys like me the capitalist It's just a good cash flow.

There's three things Inco statement balance sheet statement of cash flow. I got created a board game called cash flow That's the only game that teaches accounting, having fun. So there's Ingo Sabin, Balanchine's Tape and a Cash Flow. And the reason I created it was Maria Montessori, you know, one of the great educational entrepreneurs of all times, she says, what the hand does.

The mind remembers. So how did I get rich was I played Monopoly. What [00:22:00] was the first asset you bought in this, in, in this journey for yourself? That was a challenge. The first asset was my challenge was I couldn't pay anything for it. I had to get it for free. So I had to use debt to buy it. So my rich dad was a great guy, man.

He was a son of a. Oh, he's. So, you go buy your first piece of real estate in Hawaii, and Hawaii real estate's expensive. So, I bought a one bedroom, one bath condo on the beach, and I bought it with my credit card. Wow. 100 percent debt financing. That's the secret to success. So, when Dave Ramsey said, I'm literally debt free, I said, well, that's your philosophy.

It's not mine. Again, there's always three sides to a coin. On the light side, all the idiots think, I'm debt free. On the dark side, you guys are idiots. I want debt. Always three sides. There's no such thing as a one sided [00:23:00] coin. The So one of the things that's hard to try to think about that is, especially with real estate, is real estate prices go like this.

So depending on where we are in this boom and bust cycle, you might be taking out a lot of debt on an asset that turns around and ends up Losing quite a bit of its value. I guess it'd be stupid. Well, but it's easy to say that after the fact. How do you know? When do people buy, when does a village idiot buy real estate?

At the top. Oh, prices are going up. I'd better jump in. You know, it's called formal fear of missing out. The village idiots are running in there. It's like right now, they're all running into Bitcoin and stuff like this. The stock market today, all time highs. Idiots are just jumping in like lemmings is going to die.

So talk about the emotional, um, control that people need to have to be [00:24:00] able to do this kind of thing. Very good question. The human body is made up of four different types. You have the mind, you have the body. So this mental intelligence, physical intelligence. There's spiritual intelligence and emotional intelligence, EQ.

And the average person has no EQ, very low spiritual intelligence. The reason I know that is because I was a Marine, went to Vietnam twice. is being mentally intelligent, physically, you know, physically, spiritually, emotion. And when you see your friends dying, it's really, really imperative. Remain stoic, calm, and you keep killing the other guy.

That's what we do. Yeah, that's hard stuff. Most people don't know what that's about. No. And then when I came back from Vietnam the second time in 72, I got hit by a [00:25:00] rotten egg and spit on by all these hippies from Woodstock, you know. And today I see them around, I see them in politics today. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, they're all those hippies out there spitting on me.

I'm only kidding, you know what I mean? I don't think you're kidding. I think that's not a joke. No, I see. My job, I mean, I'm, I'm Boomer. My question I ask a lot of guys my age is, and what did you do during Vietnam? Well, I had a student deferment, oh, okay, I know who you are now, or I was in Canada. I said, oh, good, good, good, good, good.

Dodged it. So do we have to be absolute killers to be able to weather the financial storms? No, I didn't say that. Help me, help me navigate. I say there's four intelligences, mental, emotional, spiritual, physical. You look at a guy like Tiger Woods, he's got mental, emotional, physical, spiritual. lined up. That putt, you [00:26:00] know, let's say he's putting 10 feet to win a million bucks.

It's mental spiritual. And that's why Maria Montessori, Montessori school system says, what the hand does, the mind remembers. It's physical intelligence that's more important than mental intelligence. My son, uh, spent most of his academicism, K through 12 in Montessori style schools, and I'm a big fan, but I hadn't heard that phrase.

That's a really powerful phrase that the hand does, the mind remembers. I feel like so much of our education system is purely abstract and not physical. It's the exact opposite. It's emotional. They punish you for making mistakes. How stupid is that? So you have so many people that say, but what if I make a mistake?

I said, you'll get smarter. You know, a baby doesn't learn to walk unless it falls down. But let's say the baby stands up, falls down, and the teacher goes, You stupid, stupid kid! You can't walk! [00:27:00] Can't walk! They'll never walk. So when I meet people who are the academic types of that piece of paper that means nothing, most of them are so terrified of making mistakes, they say, What you do is so risky!

Well, risk involves mental, emotional, spiritual, physical. And our schools make you ri They do! I've got a piece of paper that says that means you're an idiot. You know, show me my, show me your financials. You know, I, my license plate on my car, I have a, I have a V12 Bentley and I do have an EV also. The V12 is 1.

9 GPA. I just, I go down the street. There is, I mean, there is a, um, there is a resentment in academia towards the rich. Towards the rich, but also there's a kind, and I, that, this goes back a long time. There's a sort of like, the merchant class has always been a vile, yeah, because, yeah. Why do you think [00:28:00] that is?

It seems almost like a deeply human quality, because it's not just here in America, it's throughout history. We have different values, you know what I mean? We all have different, different values. So for the academic types who are generally, you know, in school I used to call 'em Nerds, , I was a surfer, you know,

Hey Robert, I was a nerd. Back off, okay, . The surfers were cool, you know, I was flunking outta school, but we're cool. And they said they're going Well, I'm gonna go a good school. I said, good. I'm gonna be surfing. It's just values. I still got into Naval Academy. I'm not stupid, but I'm also not that naive. So to go to military school, you have to be mental, emotional, physical, spiritual.

You know, in America, we Lead the world in fatherlessness. One in four. In fatherlessness. Yes. One in four. for saying that. Students. One in four kids are living in their [00:29:00] home without a biological step or adoptive father. You had two dads. Yes. You had your, you had your biological dad, poor, poor dad with his PhD, and, and, and rich dad.

Yes. A mentor, friend, friend. So you were rich, you were doubly rich on that score. Yes. Thank you. What do you say? But that's why your program is perfect name. It's a big part of why we do it. Yes. Fathers are not carrying the load today. I meet so many young women today who say, I can't find a man. You know, they're TikTok dancers now.

Laughter. You're boomer ing it up here, Trafford. You know, Marines, Marines have an attitude problem. Um, but what, what is your advice for, for young men who, who don't have the benefit of having a dad? To impart these things, you know, obviously you're out [00:30:00] there. You've been out there for a long time.

Preaching this gospel, but if I'm a young man and I, I am, uh, I'm stuck. That's a great question. What should my body do first so that my mind can That's a very good question because when I realized, this is what happened. I grew up in Hawaii. My father's head of education. On one side of the street, there's a kid, schools.

The elementary school for labor union kids, it was called Union School. So the kids that went there were union members. Their fathers were either Portuguese, Filipino, Chinese, Korean, like that. Directly, I mean less than 20 yards across the street was Riverside School. The school for the rich kids, so their fathers owned the plantations that the union kids worked for.

I talk about a cycle farm, I'm going, so for some reason, my father didn't cheat, but I got into the rich kids school. [00:31:00] So I'm sitting there for the first time in nine years old going, how come they're poor or rich? These guys are, what's the difference? That was a question. So then I'm in Sunday school and flunking out of Sunday school, two months, I'm sitting on the earth and the teacher says, Why were the three wise men wise?

I raised my hand. She goes, why? Because they were rich. She goes, and you know, in church, the love of money is root of all evil, right? Yeah. So when I say But it is the love of money. It's not money. People make that mistake. I understand, but it's the cop out for being poor. Oh, I all know the game. I'm not idiot.

So I sat there going, she goes. Uh, I said, why do you, she said, why do you think they're rich? I said, well, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, that costs money. And she goes, how do you know that? I said, well, I study money. I do study money. And she goes, that didn't make them rich. I said, well, what did? And [00:32:00] then she said the magic words.

They sought the best teacher. So, you know, Christians, Jesus Christ. Buddhism, it's Buddha. And I went, so my job as a kid is to seek the best teacher? She goes, yes. And so I'm in a, I'm in a rich kid's school across the street, other union kids, laborer's kids. And I went looking for a teacher. And that's when I found my rich dad, who was my best friend's father in the same school.

One of the things Okay, so please hear me. Seek your teachers. And YouTube and what you guys are doing, you're giving the world access to millions of teachers. So I think YouTube's good and bad to it, but seek out the best teachers. One of the things for a lot, and I have a 19 year old son and he's doing great, but he, his peers, a lot of them, when they do that, they say, okay, I, I [00:33:00] don't believe the nonsense I'm being told.

I'm being told I'm toxic and this and that communism and I'm like, I don't like any of that. So they go online and they encounter characters like Andrew Tate and others who are essentially pitching them. It's not all bad with what they say. Some of it's helpful, but some of it's just kind of get rich quick scam artistry.

How should someone recognize when that's what's going on. Because if you don't have a, you don't have that knowledge and you're looking for your first teacher and they turn out to be some Ponzi scheme bozo, you might not know that they're a Ponzi scheme bozo. Oh, they got a Bugatti. They might, they're, they're like the three wise men, but just with Bugattis and harems and stuff.

So they're sort of like a demonic. Well, it's pretty, if it's too good to be true, it's probably fake, you know, but. The best podcast I've ever done. One of those get rich quick guys came on my [00:34:00] show. He was hoping that my audience, you know, would infiltrate his audience and all that stuff. And he was giving what I, uh, I thought was the worst advice, and he's pretty famous to me to this day.

He's still up there. I took him on, you know, the SOB, I was, uh, I chewed him out, and I thought it was the worst thing I'd ever done, and to this day, people come up to me and say, that was the best podcast I've heard, because I took him on. What's your definition of leadership? You should be able to unite and focus a group.

King's Point, the school I went to. Number one school in leadership. The first word, the first word we learned at King's Point, mission. Mission is spiritual. What are you here to do? Then your job as a leader is to unite and focus and focus energy. I've run small businesses for a little over a decade and this has been maybe the biggest lesson I've learned over, over that time [00:35:00] is having a vision and mission.

If you're trying to lead an organization, ends up being the most important thing you end up doing. Your job is to unite in the, in spirit. So, you know, that's, that's why I, I say when I came back from Vietnam, I got spit on and hit by rotten eggs. And they just didn't see, they say we called us killers, which we did.

But when your friend doesn't come home, you know, we're in a carrier and we're sitting there and go, what happened to him? I said, did you see him go down? No, we didn't see him go down. They don't come back. It's the most empty feeling. So there was so many nights I'd be on my carrier, be sitting on the bow of the ship and that's when you get closer to God, you know, you go, why am I still here?

Why is he gone? So the Vietnam wall was a good thing in D. C., you know, I, I go there and say, oh, I said goodbye to my friends, but then to [00:36:00] come home and get spit on, hit with rotten eggs. My commanding officer said it the best, I said, gentlemen, we fought for the right for them to do that to us. I don't want it.

Hmm. That's freedom of expression. We fought for that right, that spirit, that's mission, that's leadership. You know, we could've just broke out our guns and shot them all there, which wouldn't be too politically correct. No, no, that would be sociopathic. Yeah. Crossed my mind though, you know, I said, I shot better people than you, but I'm walking here with eggs and spit on and called baby killer.

And my, one of my best friends, Robbie, never came back, you know, so it took me going to the wall to say goodbye. What do you say to those who believe that your generation has really [00:37:00] screwed things up for our kids? I don't know that I believe this, like, oh, the boomers wrecked America, but it's certainly something that people say.

What's your response to that? Well, there's some truth to it, you know, I mean, I'm not denying it, but if you study This has happened every time we print money. So, you know, I'm a student of money. I don't know why. That's my only interest. There wasn't a class called money at school. I just studied, you know, on my own.

Just a greedy bastard from an early age. Yeah, yeah. But when you print money, two things happen. And this one. So Nixon was the guy that printed money. Yeah. First guy. And it was from the Bret, Bretton Woods, all the history, look at how they came up. Every time they printed money, there's been war. So I brought that The Greenback and the Civil War, 1920s.

The Weimar Republic had brought Hitler to power. Yes. I was in Zimbabwe when Zimbabwe went down. But when you study money, every time you print money, two [00:38:00] things happen. The rich get richer, poor middle class get poorer. And the reason for that is when you print money, so called assets of value go up. But also expenses for food and things go up.

So when I, when you see homelessness increasing, the more we print money, the more homelessness because they can't afford the house. This has been a really interesting thing that's happened that's, um, in America right now, which is we had this razy acceleration in the price of housing and interest rates collapsed So that you could get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage below 3 percent and now That's all but started to be turned upside down and it's created a really weird moment where interest rates are high Prices have gone up [00:39:00] the housing market hasn't crashed Inflation has gone up.

So it's it's As I've been more of a student of like basic macroeconomics than finance, I'm like behind in finance, frankly. I mean, not at the basic level we're talking about, but, um, where do we go from here? What, what do you, what's your sense of, of how the next several years is going to play out? Okay. So you are on a, the price of housing went up.

But inflation went up. So it's a double edged sword if you're making less than 100, 000 a year, how do you afford a house? Can't. Because you go to the supermarket and your cash is sucked out of there on the expense column. But that's by the no financial education in our schools. They don't have to teach you that stuff.

They got some guy with a PhD and a paper you go. So that's, that's the problem. And another thing I was taught at the academy, you know, 'cause of ring knockers, [00:40:00] you watch what a person does, not what they say. So that's why I'm, I'm, I observe people. So this guy Biden, his fir not Republican or Democrat, is his first act was, you know what it was this very first ad.

The student loans wasn't that or no, no, that was Obama. Oh. Another criminal. But anyway, no, it's. You're not wrong, he's assassinating American citizens around the world, he's technically a criminal. Yeah. Now, when, when you, um, when he cut, his first act was to cut the Keystone XL pipeline. And I went to King's Point, okay, I'm an oil man, my first job was with Standard Oil.

I understand oil. When he cut the pipeline, I own oil wells. And the moment he cut the pipeline that day, oil went under Trump, I was selling oil for 30 a barrel. Next day was 130. So that's what he lined your pockets [00:41:00] with that. I almost voted for Biden after that one. Trump cut the prices down. And so of the 130, I'm making money hand over fist, but I knew exactly what he was doing.

Because that's what Marxist guys did. By raising the cost of living, or inflation, you now have two classes. So what Biden did was he created another class called the upper middle class became poor. He did it intentionally. I watched that going, God, why? And so you notice what's happened, and then you see.

Homelessness increase and all this stuff. It's intentional. And that's what Trump was fighting, the deep state or the dark side, whatever he was fighting. So when you see that stuff, I go, wow. His second step was open the border. Watch what a person does, not what they say. So Trump was putting up a wall. I know people hate Trump.

He's a good friend of mine. He was putting a wall up so we had some protection. [00:42:00] Biden took it down. Watch what a person does, not what they say. But people can't hear, watch what Biden's doing because they hate Trump so much. Well, Trump's really made it hard in that. He often sounds like a crazy person. So if you're inclined to listen to what people say versus what they do, Trump doesn't make it easy to judge him on that basis.

Oh, he makes sense to me. No, it's, you know, it's, it's, it's really, I know I'm for you. Your sons are not really good for that. I actually owe. Um, throughout college, I waited tables at Trump Marina. So I actually technically was a Trump employee during my college years. I asked this question of every guest, you know, we call this Dad Saves America because I think, um.

I think dads are the role we get to inhabit as men that makes the biggest difference in our society. I know. How do you understand your role in the American story? That's a really good question, you know, because I'll say it again, I was, [00:43:00] I flunked out of school because I can't write and I wrote Rich Dad Poor Dad and every publisher because they're like my poor dads.

They, they turned my book down saying, you don't know what you're talking about. You say, you think you know money, but they think they know money. They have a 401k, that's why, you know, full of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. I wouldn't touch that stuff. So I had to self publish Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I put the books in my friend's car wash in Austin, Texas because nobody would buy them.

I published them and said, now, now what do I do? And it was in this car wash and then my friend said, they're not selling. I said, well, they don't give me some time. Finally the book sold. And then I got a phone call from Dallas, Texas. This is Austin to the car wash, Dallas. So hi, my name's Bill Galvin. I said, how you doing Bill?

He says, I bought your book. I said, good, it's a good book. And he said, um, how many you got? I said, 1000 minus 12. [00:44:00] And he goes, I'll take the rest. And I went, who are you? So I made a mistake. Who are you? He says, I work for Amway. And I was very close minded to Amway. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Because I don't need, I don't have.

And because of Amway, my book went all over the world. Oh, so they put it out through their network. But it was a different system. See, businesses are systems, this is a system, you know, and then Oprah called. And the next thing you know, I'm going, who's Oprah? Because, you know, Marines don't watch Oprah. I wasn't, I wasn't going to go on the program.

My wife grabbed me, she says, look, you stupid SOB, you're going on Oprah. I said, oh, okay, okay, okay. So I fly to Chicago, I go on the Oprah show, next thing I'm famous. And then Trump called. So I wish I could say it was my brilliant marketing. It wasn't. So what I'm, long answer, what I'm doing today, [00:45:00] I'm going to start a network marketing system to teach capitalism throughout the world.

We need it now more than ever. That's how you learn from your mistakes. Robert, thanks for being on Dad Saves America. Thank you. Thank you. Keep up the great work. I appreciate that.
